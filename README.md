# DLIME: A Deterministic Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations Approach for Computer Aided Diagnostic Systems
## Experiments

### Setup Environment
The following python environment and packages are used to conduct the experiments:

*  python==3.6
*  Boruta==0.1.5
*  numpy==1.16.1
*  pandas==0.24.2
*  scikit-learn==0.20.2
*  scipy==1.2.1

These packages can be installed by executing the following command: ``pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt``

### Dataset
To conduct the experiments we have used the following three healthcare datasets from UCI repository:

*  [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
*  [Hepatitis Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/hepatitis)
*  [Indian Liver Patient Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset))

Breast cancer dataset comes along with scikit-learn package, therefore, there is no need to download this dataset. The rest of the datasets are already download and available inside the "data" folder in csv format.

### Algorithms
The following classifiers and algorithms are used in this study:

*  Random Forest
*  Neural Networks
*  Linear Regression
*  K-Nearest Neighbours
*  Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

In the experiments, 80% data is used for training and the remaining 20% data is used for testing. Further, the Random Forest, Neural Networks and KNN classifiers are trained with the following parameters:

RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, random_state=0, max_depth=5, max_features=5)

MLPClassifier(solver='lbfgs', alpha=1e-5, hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 2), random_state=1)

NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1, algorithm='ball_tree')

AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=2, affinity='euclidean', compute_full_tree='auto', connectivity=None, linkage='ward', memory=None)


### Execute Code
Run the following files to reproduce the results. The results of LIME are not deterministic and it may produce different results.
